I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University, advised by [Prof. Hongyu Zhao](https://zhaocenter.org/index.html). I completed my Ph.D. at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Can Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/eeyangc/) and [Prof. Yang Wang](https://www.presidentsoffice.hku.hk/leadership/professor-yang-wang).

My research interests include the development of machine learning and deep learning methdologies with applications in multi-omics data analysis.
